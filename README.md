# Dancing Links (DLX) - Solving Sudoku

## Background
When deciding which algorithm to pursue for my sudoku solver, efficiency in the algorithm was my upmost priority. After some search into various algorithms, I discovered various algorithms with varying time complexity. One approach involved a standard depth-first search algorithm, which has a time complexity of O(n^2), where n is both the size of the square grid and number of possible numbers a cell can hold. This approach would be highly achievable due to it being covered in the unit material and can be paired with constraint satisfaction. However, after further research, I discovered that it is possible for sudoku of a fixed nxn size to be solved in O(1) time. NP completeness is a concept which applies to any decision-based problem that has a variable input size. Should the input size, n not be fixed, the time complexity would be O(n) (NP complete), because could hold a value up to infinity. In this case, the algorithm would spend O(n) time simply reading the input as it can't expect what size the grid will be beforehand. 

In terms of sudoku, NP-completeness is achievable because any sudoku is reducible to the exact cover problem; an algorithm which is known to be NP complete. The exact cover problem is a type of constraint satisfaction problem and can be represented visually using a binary sparse matrix. In this binary sparse matrix, the columns represent constraints and rows represent possible values. A '1' present in any given intersection represents an incidence relation (the constraint is satisfied for that possible value), and a 0 otherwise. Donald Knuth refers to these 1's as *data objects*, and it should be noted that each row will contain only a single *data object* for each constraint range. 

## Dancing Links
One very efficient way of finding all solutions to the exact cover problem is by using Algorithm X. Algorithm X is a recursive, nondeterministic algorithm that utilizes depth-first search to support backtracking. It is referred to as DLX when efficiently implemented using the Dancing Links technique (Knuth et al., 2000). DLX was originally invented by Hiroshi Hitotsumatsu and Kohei Noshita, but later popularised by Donald Knuth and is a technique that can be used to undo the operation of removing a given node from a circular doubly linked list. See the example code below for a basic overview of how this works. In the case of DLX, each column also has a special column node at the top of every column, which contains identifying information as well as its size (the number of *data objects*). These special column nodes are referred to as a *column objects*. Additionally, there is also a head node prepending the first *column object* and can be used to enter the circular doubly linked list.

```python
# Where foo represents a node in a circular doubly linked list and the left
# and right attributes refer to the nodes to the left and right of foo.

# These two lines will remove foo from the doubly linked list.
foo.right.left = foo.left
foo.left.right = foo.right

# These two lines will restore foo's position in the list.
# Even though foo's reference was removed from its neighbour's above,
# we are able to restore its position in the list because foo retained
# which neighbours were to its left and right.
foo.right.left = foo
foo.left.right = foo
```

## Reduction of Sudoku to the Exact Cover Problem
To reduce a 9x9 sudoku to the exact cover problem, it is important to understand how the rules of sudoku can be described in terms of 4 constraints (Laestander, M, 2014):
- **Cell Constraint:** A Cell can contain one integer from 1-9.
- **Row Constraint:** Each row must contain 9 unique integers from 1-9.
- **Column Constraint:** Each column must contain 9 unique integers from 1-9.
- **Box Constraint:** All 9 cells in a 3x3 box must contain 9 unique integers from 1-9.

With the above information, and given that there are 81 cells in a 9x9 sudoku puzzle, we can calculate that there will be a total of 81 x 4 = 324 columns in the binary sparse matrix. We also know there are 9 possible solutions (should there be no clue given) for each cell, so there can be up to 81 x 9 = 729 rows present. Each cell with a clue given will only add one row to the matrix due to it having only one possible value (the clue given). 

## Solving the Matrix (DLX)
Once these fundamentals have been understood, the way DLX can be applied to this cover problem is straightforward. The goal is to find a subset of 81 *data objects* that satisfy all constraints. To do this, we start searching recursively and choosing a *column object* to cover (remove from the linked list) and transfer its' *data objects* into a secondary solution list. The method for choosing this column is discussed below and is done by recursively calling the `search(solution: List[DataObject]) -> None` function, where solution is the solution list so far. Should the algorithm reach a dead end, it uses the principles of depth-first search and backtracks before trying a different *column object*.

## Choosing a Column to Cover
Within the search function exists a call to a function called `choose_column_object() -> ColumnObject`, which returns a column object present in the M. The column this returns is then next in line to be covered (removed from the linked list). Donald Knuth proposes that there are two ways to go about implementing this function. It could either return the column containing the least amount of 1's, or simply return the first column following the head. Donald Knuth suggests that the former is worth the additional computation in order to minimise the branching factor, so this is the decision I made (Knuth et al., 2000). To do this, I used a Python generator to loop over and compare the size of all columns by using an equality operator to compare each column's size to the current lowest value. Furthermore, I found with my own tests that if I returned a column with a size <= 1 (the smallest number of 1's a column could contain) immediately after coming across one, the DLX algorithm was on average an additional 0.141s quicker when completing 60 sudokus of varying difficulty. d.f. = 1000.

## Translating Back to Sudoku
Once the DLX algorithm successfully halted in a solution found state, I was able to translate the obtained solution list back to a 9x9 array of values ranging from 1-9 relatively easily. We know that the solution list contains 81 *data objects*, one for each cell in the sudoku puzzle, whereby each *data object* will contain an integer identifier as per the DLX algorithm. The solution list is first sorted by this integer identifier in descending order. Due to the domain of a 9x9 sudoku puzzle being 9, I was then able to take the modulus of 9 for each row once zero-based indices were corrected for (by adding one). This was done for all 81 values such that the first value corresponded to cell 0 in the sudoku, followed by 1, 2, 3 ... 81-1.
